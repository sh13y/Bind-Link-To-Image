## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin your journey of digital trickery, ensure you have:

1. A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (They're cool, we promise! 😎)
2. A [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account (For that extra layer of sneakiness! 🕵️‍♂️)
3. [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed (The magic wand for deployment! 🪄)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup (Supabase)

1. Create a new Supabase project (Your secret lair! 🏰)
2. Create the following table in your database (The blueprint of your master plan! 📋):

```sql
create table image_links (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  public_id text unique not null,
  filename text not null,
  destination text not null,
  og_title text,
  og_description text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Create an index for faster lookups (Speed is your friend! 🏃‍♂️)
create index image_links_public_id_idx on image_links(public_id);
```

3. Create a new storage bucket named `images` with the following settings:
   - Public bucket (Let everyone see your masterpieces! 🎨)
   - File size limit: 5MB (Keep it light, keep it sneaky! 🎯)
   - Allowed mime types: image/* (Only the good stuff! 🖼️)

### 2. Cloudflare Workers Setup

1. Install Wrangler CLI (Your trusty sidekick! 🦸‍♂️):
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. Login to Cloudflare (Time to get serious! 🎭):
```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Create a new worker (Your digital minion! 🤖):
```bash
wrangler init smart-image-link-generator
```

4. Configure your worker by creating a `wrangler.toml` file (The recipe for success! 📝):
```toml
name = "smart-image-link-generator"
main = "index.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[vars]
# Add your environment variables here (Your secret ingredients! 🧪)
# SUPABASE_URL = "your_supabase_url"
# SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your_supabase_anon_key"
```
